The chatReqest needs this JSON body and a cookie:

{
  "userS": "Email of the user that sends a reqest",
  "userR": "Email of the user that needs to accept or decline the reqest"
}

It authenticates if the user is legit
More on that in authDocs.txt

It checks if the userR and userS exist in the Users.db database
If one of them or both not exists it returns an error

Else it writes this to a Conv.db database

  user_s    user_r   status
|---------|----------|------|
emai1@.com email2@.com wating

and it returns an message
